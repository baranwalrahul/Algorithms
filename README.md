# Data Structures and Algorithms #

This repository contains my work from the Algorithmic Programming Techniques Specialization that was created by UC San Diego and delivered through Coursera. I will be implementing solutions in Java. 

## About this speciliazation ##

The Specialization covers algorithmic techniques for solving problems arising in computer science applications. It is a mix of theory and practice: you will not only design algorithms and estimate their complexity, but you will get a deeper understanding of algorithms by implementing them in the programming language of your choice (C, C++, C#, Haskell, Java, JavaScript, Python2, Python3, Ruby, and Scala).
